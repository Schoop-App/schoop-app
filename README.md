_Simple, intuitive Windward schedule app for virtual school and Zoom classes_

At the beginning of our virtual learning, I, like many other students, had trouble navigating our new virtual learning schedule and logging into Zoom classes. For that reason, I created Schoop, a web-app allowing students to see what their current class is and their schedule for the day. _More to be added!_

Any PRs and contributions would be much appreciated! (Please excuse the organization of my repo; I didn't initially think I would be making it public!) Thank you for your support.
